Plasma, aka in French “Plateforme d’e-Learning pour l’Analyse de données Scientifiques MAssives”, aims at creating 
an interactive tool to teach computational analysis of massive scientific data. 
Plasma was born out of the need to offer a reproducible and high-performance analysis environment to our students.

Based on the Jupyter ecosystem, Plasma allows the creation and the management of isolated and highly customizable environments, 
with an easy deployement on bare-metal servers or virtual machines.

Plasma utilizes `tljh-repo2docker <https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker>`_, 
a `repo2docker <https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker>`_ plugin for `The Littlest JupyterHub <https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/>`_.
