# Adding Admin Users to JupyterHub

By default the `site.yml` playbook does not add admin users to JupyterHub.

New admin users can be added by adding `admin: true` to the `users-config.yml` file
from the previous section:

```yaml
users:
  - name: foo
    password: PLAIN_TEXT_PASSWORD
    groups:
      - group_1
      - group_2
    admin: true
```

And re-running the `users.yml` playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook users.yml -i hosts -u ubuntu -e @users-config.yml
```

:::{warning}
The list of existing admin users is first reset before adding the new admin users.

Alternatively it is also possible to use the `tljh-config` command on the server directly.
Please refer to [the Littlest JupyterHub documentation](http://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/admin/admin-users.html#adding-admin-users-from-the-command-line)
for more info.
