# Monitoring

```{warning}
HTTPS must be enabled to be able to access Cockpit. Refer to {ref}`install-https` for more info.
```

## Installing Cockpit

`cockpit` is not installed by default as a monitoring tool for the server.

First make sure HTTPS is enabled and the `name_server` variable is specified in the `hosts` file.
See {ref}`install-https` for more info.

Then execute the `cockpit.yml` playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook cockpit.yml -i hosts -u ubuntu
```

The Plasma TLJH plugin registers `cockpit` as a JupyterHub service. This means that
Cockpit is accessible to JupyterHub admin users via the JupyterHub interface:

```{image} ../images/configuration/cockpit-navbar.png
:align: center
:alt: Accessing cockpit from the nav bar
:width: 100%
```

Users will be asked to login with their system credentials. They can then access the Cockpit dashboard:

```{image} ../images/configuration/cockpit.png
:align: center
:alt: Cockpit
:width: 100%
```

## Monitoring user servers with Cockpit

````{note}
Access to Docker Containers requires access to `docker`.

Make sure your user can access docker on the machine with:

```bash
sudo docker info
```

Your user should also be able to login with a password. If the user doesn't have a password yet, you can
create a new one with:

```bash
sudo passwd <username>
```

For example if your user is `ubuntu`:

```bash
sudo passwd ubuntu
```

To add more users as admin or change permissions from the Cockpit UI, see {ref}`monitoring-permissions`.
````

Since user servers are started as Docker containers, they will be displayed in the Cockpit interface in the
`Docker Containers` section:

```{image} ../images/configuration/cockpit-docker.png
:align: center
:alt: Docker Containers from Cockpit
:width: 100%
```

The Cockpit interface shows:

- The username as part of the name of the Docker container
- The resources they are currently using
- The environment currently in use

It is also possible to stop the user server by clicking on the "Stop" button.

## Changing user permissions from the Cockpit UI

```{note}
You first need to be logged in with a user that has the `sudo` permission.
:::

Cockpit makes it easy to add a specific user to a certain group.

For example a user can be given the "Container Administrator" role via the UI to be able to manage Docker containers
and images on the machine:

```{image} ../images/configuration/cockpit-roles.png
:align: center
:alt: Manage user roles from the Cockpit UI
:width: 100%
```
