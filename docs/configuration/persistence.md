## User Data

The user servers are started using JupyterHub's [SystemUserSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner#systemuserspawner).

This spawner is based on the [DockerSpawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner#dockerspawner), but makes it possible
to use the host users to start the notebook servers.

Concretely this means that the user inside the container corresponds to a real user that exists on the host.
Processes will be started by that user, instead of the default `jovyan` user that is usually found in the regular
Jupyter Docker images and on Binder.

For example when the user `foo` starts their server, the list of processes looks like the following:

```bash
foo@9cf23d669647:~$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  1.1  0.0  50944  3408 ?        Ss   11:17   0:00 su - foo -m -c "$0" "$@" -- /srv/conda/envs/notebook/bin/jupyterhub-singleuser --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --NotebookApp.default_url=/lab --ResourceUseDisplay.track_cpu_percent=True

foo         84  0.0  0.0  20312  4036 pts/0    Ss   11:17   0:00 /bin/bash -l
foo        112 29.0  0.5 458560 46448 ?        Ssl  11:17   0:00 /srv/conda/envs/notebook/bin/python -m bash_kernel -f /home/foo/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-9a7c8ad3-4ac2-4754-88cc-ef746d1be83e.json
foo        126  0.5  0.0  20180  3884 pts/1    Ss+  11:17   0:00 /bin/bash --rcfile /srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pexpect/bashrc.sh
foo        140  0.0  0.0  36076  3368 pts/0    R+   11:17   0:00 ps aux
```

The following steps happen when a user starts their server:

1. Mount the user home directory on the host into the container. This means that the file structure in the container reflects what is on the host.
2. A new directory is created in the user home directory for each new environment (i.e for each Docker image).
   For example if a user starts the `2020-python-course` environment, there will be a new folder created under `/home/user/2020-python-course`.
   This folder is then persisted to disk in the user home directory on the host. Any file and notebook created from the notebook interface are also persisted to disk.
3. On server startup, the entrypoint script copies the files from the base image that are initially in `/home/jovyan` to `/home/user/2020-python-course` in the container.
   They are then persisted in `/home/user/2020-python-course` on the host.

```{image} ../images/configuration/persistence.png
:align: center
:alt: Mounting user's home directories
:width: 80%
```

- The files highlighted in blue correspond to the files initially bundled in the environment. These files are copied to the environment subdirectory in the user home directory on startup.
- The other files are examples of files created by the user.

## User server startup

The user server is started from the environment directory:

```{image} ../images/configuration/user-server-rootdir.png
:align: center
:alt: User servers are started in the environment directory
:width: 50%
```

The rest of the user files are mounted into the container, see {ref}`persistence-user-data`.

A user can for example open a terminal and access their files by typing `cd`.

They can then inspect their files:

```text
foo@3e29b2297563:/home/foo$ ls -lisah

```

## Shared Data

In addition to the user data, the plugin also mounts a shared data volume for all users.

The shared data is available under `/srv/data` inside the user server, as pictured in the diagram above.

On the host machine, the shared data should be placed under `/srv/data` as recommended in the
[TLJH documentation](http://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/content/share-data.html#option-2-create-a-read-only-shared-folder-for-data).

The shared data is **read-only**.
