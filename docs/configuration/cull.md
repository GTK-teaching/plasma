# Culling idle servers

Plasma uses the [same defaults as The Littlest JupyterHub](http://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/topic/idle-culler.html#default-settings)
for culling idle servers.

It overrides the `timeout` value to `3600`, which means that the user servers will be shut down if they have
been idle for more than one hour.
