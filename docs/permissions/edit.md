# Editing permissions

The page to edit permissions is accessible via the navigation bar:

```

## Mapping new groups to user environments

By default, users don't have access to any environment:

```{image} ../images/permissions/permissions-empty.png
:align: center
:alt: No access to user environments
:width: 100%
```

Admins can prepare a list of environments before assigning them to user groups.

Environments can be added on a group level by clicking on the `Add Group` button and selecting
the group using the dropdown menu:

```

## Saving the changes

Save the changes by clicking on the `Submit` button.

This will reload the page and show the updated list of permissions.
